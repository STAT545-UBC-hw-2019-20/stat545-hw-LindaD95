**STAT 545A Repo**

This repository (repo) is where assignments for STAT 545A are to be submitted (STAT545-hw-LindaD95 repo) and where class participation is documented (STAT 545-participation). 

STAT 545A is a course offered by the University of British Columbia to graduate students from a variety of disciplines to learn how to manipulate data with R. 

My name is Linda Dumalo and I am in my second of a Master's of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Dr. Lindsay Eltis's lab.
