```{r allow errors, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

```{r load packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# load your packages here:
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
``` 

### Exercise 1: Basic dplyr 

```{r} 
filter(gapminder, country %in%  c("Australia", "Canada", "Germany")) 
```

#### Exercise 1.2 

Use the pipe operator %>% to select “country” and “gdpPercap” from your filtered dataset in 1.1 

```{r} 
gapminder %>%
filter(country %in%  c("Australia", "Canada", "Germany")) %>% 
  select(country, gdpPercap) 
```

#### Exercise 1.3 

Filter gapminder to all entries that have experienced a drop in life expectancy. Be sure to include a new variable that’s the increase in life expectancy in your tibble. Hint: you might find the lag() or diff() functions useful.
