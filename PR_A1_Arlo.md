Nice, Tidy (pun intendend) tables in the .Rmd file 

Coding was Very simple, easy to follow 

BUT

The tables were not seen on the PDF when I tried to knit it. 
Not sure if there was something that went wrong with converting it to the PDF  but I would think that the tables should be seen on the slides.
