Sometimes, the comments (# ____ ) seemed a bit excessive and were distracting from the code itself for the first couple of code chunks. For the rest of the assignment, the coding style was excellent. 

I especially appreciated the comments about what you were doing when there was base R being used. 


Liked the bolding of titles on the graphs but in general, they could be nicer (black and white, better data points on your analysis of the graph)

The satisfactory aesthetic though did not distract from the the thoughtful analysis
