This repository (repo) is where assignments for **STAT 545A** are to be submitted. 

**STAT 545A is a course offered by the University of British Columbia to graduate students from a variety of disciplines to learn how to manipulate data with R.** 

For more inormation about the course go to the [Course website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/)

My name is Linda Dumalo and I am currently doing a M.Sc of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Dr. Lindsay Eltis's lab. 

My research interests are: 

-Enzymology
 
  -Specifically, enzyme kinetics 

-Structural biology

-Microbiology

-Conducting proper experiments   ***controls, controls, controls***


Sometimes, science does not work or your data is less than stellar and not expected so a favourit quote from a fellow lab member is 
> *It is what it is* 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
