Good alternating use of knit::kable and DT::datable depending on the output 

Very much appreciated the capitilization of the legends on the graphs (for the most part)

I put the presentation of graphs as satisfactory because although they got the point across they were no pretty (I know that this was NOT the point of the exercise but just saying)

Picked up on a few tidying tips like hiding datasets (thanks!)
