## **Exercise 2:** Factor Management 

```{r results='hide'}
gapminder
```

The variables that are factors in the gapminder dataset are **country** and **continent**. Observations assoicated with "Ocenia" will be removed along with unused factor levels. 

To compare how dropping factors and using arange affects data, the tibble with the dropped factors will be dubbded as "gap."


```{r v0}
gap= gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent %in% c("Africa", "Asia", "Europe", "Americas")) %>% 
  droplevels()
levels(gap$continent)
  # should have some code here to display that it worked... 
```


Going to look at total GDP for the year 1997  

```{r v0: not using factors + ugly} 
gap %>%  
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  mutate(gdpTotal = gdpPercap*pop) %>%  
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(av_gdpTotal = mean(gdpTotal)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, av_gdpTotal)) + 
  geom_histogram(stat="identity") 

```

```{r}
gap %>%  
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  mutate(gdpTotal = gdpPercap*pop) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(country, gdpTotal, max)), gdpTotal) + 
  geom_histogram(stat="identity") 

```

## **Exercise 3 :** File Input/Output 

The manipulated data from exercise 2 was written and read using write.csv and read.csv respectively along with here::here(). 

```{r}
gap97 <- gap %>%  
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  mutate(gdpTotal = gdpPercap*pop) 
```


```{r write csv}
write.csv(gap97, here::here("Hw05", "gap97.csv"))  
```

```{r read csv} 
gap97a <- read.csv(here::here("Hw05", "gap97.csv"))
```

```{r}
gap97a %>% 
  select(country, gdpTotal) #summarized 
```
Currently, the data is sorted alphabetically based on the factor country. 

```{r}
gap97a %>% 
  fct_reorder(country, gdpTotal, .desc = TRUE) 
```


Manipulating the factors based on the data (change this wording)

## **Exercise 4:** Data Visualization  

In Assignment 2 we looked at the GDP per capita versus the life expectancy of Canada. I wanted to extend the analysis to 2 other countries,, specifically China and Brazil 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Canada"| country == "China" | country == "Brazil") %>% # add other countries 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, colour = country)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  xlab("GDP per Capita") + 
  ylab("Life Exptectancy") 
```

I wanted to compare the trends between the 3 countries and felt that it was hard to tell the trends on the same plot. So I decided to use facet_wrap() as previously had been done in class. 

```{r, fig.width = 11, fig.height = 5}
#  {r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 2}
gap3 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada"| country == "China" | country == "Brazil") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, fill = country, colour = country, labels = year)) +
  facet_wrap(~ country, nrow = 1) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma_format()) + 
  xlab("GDP Per Capita") + 
  ylab("Life Expectancy (Years)") +
  ggtitle(" GDP per Capita versus Life Expectancy") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, face="bold")) +
  scale_size_area() +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        plot.title = element_text(size=16, face="bold"), 
        legend.position = "none")
gap3
```

Save the plot tto folder. 

```{r}
gap3
ggsave("gap3.png") 
# way to use here::here() package? 
```
