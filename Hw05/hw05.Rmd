```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
```

## **Exercise 2:** Factor Management 

```{r results='hide'}
gapminder
```

The variables that are factors in the gapminder dataset are **country** and **continent**. Observations assoicated with "OCenia" will be removed along with unused factor levels. 

```{r}
gapminder$continent %>% 
  nlevels()

```
There are 5 levels originally in the gapminder dataset for continent. Removal of Ocenia reduces it to 4. 

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  factor(c("Africa", "Asia", "Europe", "Americas")) %>% 
  nlevels() 
  # should have some code here to display that it worked... 
```


After filterring, the number of rows decreased from 1704 to to 1680 rows
