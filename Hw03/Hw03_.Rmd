```{r setup, include=FALSE, message=F}

library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(ggridges)
library(scales)
knitr::kable 
``` 


## Option 3 

Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents. 
Goal: Create a jitterplot with the continents on the x asis and the GDP per capita on the x 

```{r}
#maybe change some dimensions 
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year > 1980) %>% 
  # maybe rename the year variable to year here 
  rename("Year" = "year") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap, colour = Year)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.3) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.08) + 
  xlab("Continent") +
  ylab("GDP per Capita") +
  theme_bw() 
  # bonus is to remove the grid lies 
```
